            Solve the following quadratic equations using the quadratic formula:
            a) 3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0
            b) 2x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0
            c) x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0
            
            Determine the nature of the roots for each of the equations in question 1.
            
            For the equation 2x^2 + kx + 3 = 0, find the values of k for which the equation has real roots.
            
            Solve the quadratic equation 2(x - 1)^2 - 3 = 0 and express the solutions in the simplest radical form.
            
            Research and write a short explanation of the significance of the discriminant in quadratic equations.
